# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Data Science and ML

This project is part of a hands-on, beginner-friendly course created by IBM, available at [CognitiveClass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/), aimed at teaching effective EDA techniques to enhance data science and machine learning projects.

## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is one of the most crucial steps in any data science project. It involves inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data to extract meaningful insights, which will, in turn, guide your data modeling and machine learning workflows. This repository offers a comprehensive guide to performing EDA with a focus on:

- **Data Summarization**: Understanding the main features of your dataset.
- **Visualization**: Plotting and visualizing trends, patterns, and outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between variables.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Techniques for managing incomplete datasets.
- **Outlier Detection**: Recognizing anomalies in the data.
- **Insights for Model Building**: Using EDA to inform decisions on feature selection, transformations, and model selection.

The repository focuses on EDA for both **regression** and **classification** problems, which are common in machine learning.

## What You'll Learn

- How to perform basic EDA to uncover key insights from your dataset.
- The use of various visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to explore data patterns.
- Methods for handling missing data and identifying outliers.
- Insights to improve feature selection and model performance for regression and classification tasks.
- How to set up a solid foundation for machine learning models with EDA.
